# Xor-Neural-Network
This is a simulation of XOR using a nerual network written in C++ with the use of Eigen.

I have chosen to solve the normal equations first to find the bias parameter. The network is a feed forward network consisting of one fully connected layer for the inputs, connected to a hidden layer which feeds forward to the output. For the hidden layer we use the Relu function and output we use the Sigmoid function.

As a reference I used "Ian Goodfellow et al, Deep Learning" to teach myself concepts allowing me to write this program.
